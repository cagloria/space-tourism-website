This is a solution to the [Space tourism website challenge provided by Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## The Challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

## Technologies Used

-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript library
-   [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) - CSS-in-JS tool
-   [React Router](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router) - React JavaScript library

## Installation

You will need [Node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed to run this project.

Clone the project and run `npm install` in the root directory.

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

## Running in Development Mode

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Testing

`npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## Building

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
