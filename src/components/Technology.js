            <p>
                A launch vehicle or carrier rocket is a rocket-propelled vehicle
                used to carry a payload from Earth's surface to space, usually
                to Earth orbit or beyond. Our WEB-X carrier rocket is the most
                powerful in operation. Standing 150 metres tall, it's quite an
                awe-inspiring sight on the launch pad!
